# üçÖ  Pomodoro Timer

A calculator based on the Pomodoro Technique. 

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato!

The process goes like this:
- Decide on the task to be done.
- Start the Pomodoro timer (here 25 minutes).
- Work on the task.
- End work when the timer stops and take a short break (here 5 minutes).
- Go back to Step 2 and repeat until you complete four pomodoros.
- After four pomodoros are done, take a long break (here 20 minutes) instead of a short break. Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.

I use this technique often when studying or working for long periods of time. Hope you have fun playing with it!
